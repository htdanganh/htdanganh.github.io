<br/>

Welcome to my comfort spot. I am Anh, and I am a student at Georgia Tech. I am currently studying Computer Science, diving into the deeper wonders of AI and ML. I am joyous to share my tidbits of projects and hobbies through this website.

In my free time, I love to learn about new things, whether it be a new skill, hobby, or activity. I am an avid journaler, and I love to collect various types of notebooks and fountain pens to write with. I also love to take photos, specializing in digital photography and occasionally film photography.
